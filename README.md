****Getting Started****

**Installations:**

3. In the backend src>db>scheme.sql, it includes the database structure:

Without a backend framework, lets just quick download a mysqlworkbench and run these sql statements to create database and tables manually.

4. For backend:
   Making sure the docker desktop is running
   Run command: make bash
                make seeds
   (This helps generating 100+ records into the database)
